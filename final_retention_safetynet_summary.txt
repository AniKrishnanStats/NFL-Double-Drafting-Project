MULTI-YEAR TEAM IMPROVEMENT MODEL
---------------------------------
Base yearly slope: +0.025
Single×year interaction: -0.029
Zero×year interaction: -0.023
Effect of retained snaps: +0.149

L-NCI (demeaned) means:
            mean       std  count
grp                              
double -0.273013  1.151152  134.0
single  0.022156  0.842626  778.0
zero    0.000557  0.157756  912.0

SAFETY-NET MODEL
----------------
Coefficient (is_double): +4.183
Odds Ratio (double vs others): 65.57

Interpretation:
If odds < 1 → double-drafting reduces the probability both rookies bust
(<30% defensive snaps in Y+2) → diversification effect.
