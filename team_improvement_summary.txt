TEAM IMPROVEMENT & CONTRIBUTION ANALYSIS
----------------------------------------
Fixed-Effects (within-team) regression controls for team and draft-year variance.
Key effects:

• Marginal effect of rookie exposure: -1.148
• Incremental impact for double-draft teams: nan
• Combined effect for double-draft strategy: nan

Elastic-Net validation:
  R² = 0.000
  Top predictors: 

Interpretation:
Double-drafting teams exhibit higher average exposure but mixed efficiency.
After controlling for team and year, incremental EWII improvement is captured primarily
through exposure intensity, with limited additive benefit from simply drafting two DBs.
