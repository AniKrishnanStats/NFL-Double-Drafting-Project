MULTI-YEAR RETENTION & IMPROVEMENT ANALYSIS
-------------------------------------------
Average yearly EWII slope: 0.0233
Effect of retained rookie-class snaps: 0.0934

Interpretation:
Positive retained-snap coefficient means that teams whose original rookie DBs
continue playing meaningful snaps in later years sustain higher improvement.
Negative interaction terms for single/zero indicate faster decay of gains.
