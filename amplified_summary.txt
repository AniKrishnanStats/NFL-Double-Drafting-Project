AMPLIFIED RESULTS SUMMARY
--------------------------
1. Verified logic — zero-draft teams now contribute 0%.
2. Rookie snap share (defense only, R1–R3):
   • Double: 6.3%
   • Single: 3.3%
   • Zero:   0.0%

3. Normalized contribution = rookie_snap_share * team_improvement / 100
   • Double-draft teams: -0.00% avg contribution
   • Single-draft teams: -0.00%
   • Zero-draft teams:   0.00%

4. Amplified OLS shows per 1% increase in rookie snap share → Δ-8.28% normalized contribution.
